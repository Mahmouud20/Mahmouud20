The Backend-PHP Core tier is meant as a standalone system which acts in a basic
Request / Response model, using the MVC architecture. It's only dependancy is on
the Interfaces tier. Any extra dependancies should be implemented in the Base tier.

This enables this tier to act as a good foundation from where to build other frameworks
or systems.
